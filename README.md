Standing at the threshold of the information age, financial services industry become the perfect playing field for machine learning technologies. We dedicate to develop applications of deep learning in finance, study the causal relationship between the data, and make progress on related computer science theory.  

The project adopts deep learning models for financial data visualization. In financial trading, techniques like pattern recognition could advance the efficiency of strategic decision. The professional traders could identify specific patterns among the candlestick charts with their long years of experience, while a convolutional neural network (CNN) in deep learning extracts spatial features from data. Compared to the model which is designed to work on time series problem, the training process of CNN model tend to be more similar to how human learns to study financial data.
